# Robotic Lathe Machine ðŸ¤–

A miniature, automated lathe machine that tracks a line profile and cuts that shape into a rotating piece of foam.

## Background

This project was built for our end-of-term design project in my 1A (first) semester of Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Our team had a keen interest in applying robotics to manufacturing, so we decided to build an automated lathe machine to help easily design and manufacture (foam) components.

The skeleton/frame of the machine was built with aluminum extrusions, the spindle arm was primarily constructed using LEGO Tetrix, and various components in between were custom-designed and 3D-printed. The software was run through a LEGO EV3 brain written in C. 

The machine functions by following a hand-drawn line profile using a colour sensor. As it traces this line, the spindle arm cuts into a rotating piece of foam, replicating the line profile it's following. 

## Building Your Own

This GitHub repository contains both the C code used in our machine as well as the CAD components we custom-designed to make this project. 

If you're interested in replicating or learning more about the automated lathe machine, we developed a detailed, 60+ page report that goes into detail about the scope, mechanical design, software design, design implementation, and constraints and criteria of the project.
