A miniature, automated lathe machine that tracks a line profile and cuts that shape into a rotating piece of foam.

## Background

This project was built for our end-of-term design project in my 1A (first) semester of Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 

The skeleton/frame was built with aluminum extrusions, the spindle arm was primarily constructed using LEGO Tetrix, and various components in between were custom-designed and 3D-printed.
